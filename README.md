#Phishing Email Analysis
Summary

#his repository contains a concise, reproducible analysis of a suspicious (phishing) email sample. It is designed to be used as a submission for coursework or as a template for security triage/playbook documentation.

#Objectives
- Identify phishing indicators in the sample email. - Document evidence and reasoning clearly so non-technical reviewers can understand. - Provide recommended remediation for end users and IT/security teams. - Supply artifacts that can be committed to a Git repository and shared with stakeholders.
Repository Structure
/ (root) ├─ README.md                  # (this file) ├─ analysis.md                # Full written analysis and findings ├─ sample_email.eml           # Raw email used for analysis (safe example domains) ├─ headers.txt                # Extracted/sampled email headers ├─ screenshot_analysis.png    # Annotated screenshot summarizing key indicators └─ Phishing_Task_2.zip        # ZIP of this repository (optional)
Step-by-step Analysis Procedure (Playbook)
1. Preserve evidence (save raw email and headers). 2. High-level triage (review subject/sender/urgency). 3. Verify sender address and domain. 4. Analyze headers for Received, SPF, DKIM anomalies. 5. Inspect links (anchor vs actual URL). 6. Handle attachments safely (sandboxed analysis). 7. Review language and social engineering tactics. 8. Cross-check with known good templates. 9. Classify severity. 10. Report and remediate.
Indicators & Findings (Quick Checklist)
- Sender name/address mismatch - Unusual sender domain - SPF/DKIM failures - Suspicious Received headers - Urgent or threatening language - Generic greetings - Mismatched links - Suspicious attachments - Typos or grammar issues - Use of shorteners/redirects
Recommended Actions & Remediation
For recipients: - Do not click links or open attachments. - Verify with official sources. - Report to IT/security team.  For IT/security teams: - Block sender domains/IPs. - Enforce SPF, DKIM, DMARC. - Run awareness campaigns.  For incident responders: - Collect evidence. - Isolate affected devices. - Reset exposed credentials.
Tools & Commands Used
- less / code editor (for .eml) - curl --head (safe header check) - dig, whois (domain checks) - Online header analyzers (MXToolbox) - Email client raw source view
